# Chess
### Author Ben Platt
### *Updated 12/23/2021
### Fully functioning chess game made in python! GUI made using Tkinter. Note that this project is not perfect by any means and may still include bugs (either weird visuals or pieces not moving like they should. Although I think i squashed most of them). But this was just meant as a fun winter break project so I could learn more python.

### Also all the code was written in the same file because tkinter is weird with having different files/classes. To compensate I tried to organize the sections better.
### Features not included (for simplicities sake):
#### -En passant move for pawns
#### -Stalemate match result 
#### -Checkmate (Although you should quickly figure out if you are in checkmate. The game won't let you proceed)
#### -Restart game (Since no end of game conditions are included)

#### Extensions required to run in python:

#### Images:
